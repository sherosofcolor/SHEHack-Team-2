# Guardian - Workplace Harassment Detection Slack App

## Overview

Guardian is a Slack app designed to detect and flag potential workplace harassment within Slack channels. It uses a pre-trained Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to analyze messages and identify offensive content. The app aims to create a safer and more respectful work environment by providing real-time feedback and alerts.

## Problem Statement
Most of the solutions to harassment detection in workplace depends primarily on manual reporting procedures which often fail to capture the full extent of the issue. Victims frequently hesitate to report incidents due to fear of retaliation, lack of trust in the system, or uncertainty about the consequences. As a result, many cases of harassment go unreported, allowing toxic behaviors to persist unchecked. 

## Impact of Solution
Our solution proactively detects offensive language in real-time and empowers users by requesting confirmation before escalating issues. By continuously monitoring interactions, it helps create a safer, more respectful workspace while minimizing false escalations. This approach not only fosters a culture of accountability and inclusivity but also enhances trust and well-being in professional environments.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run Guardian locally:

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**: Ensure you have Python 3.7 or a later version installed on your system.
- **Conda (Recommended)**: It is recommended to use Conda to create a virtual environment and manage dependencies. You can download and install Conda from [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
- **Slack App**: You will need to create a Slack app and obtain the necessary API tokens and signing secret. Follow the instructions in the Slack API documentation to set up your app.

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the Guardian repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DivyaSri973/Guardian.git
cd Guardian
```

#### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

Using Conda:

```bash
conda create -n guardian_env python=3.9
conda activate guardian_env
```

Using venv:

```bash
python3 -m venv guardian_env
source guardian_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: guardian_env\Scripts\activate
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

You need to set the following environment variables:

- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Slack bot token (xoxb-...).
- `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`: Your Slack signing secret.

You can set these variables in your terminal or in a `.env` file.

For example, using a `.env` file:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
2. Add the following lines, replacing the values with your actual tokens:

    ```bash
    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token
    SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your-signing-secret
    ```

3. If using a `.env` file, install `python-dotenv`:

    ```bash
    pip install python-dotenv
    ```

4. Load the variables in your `app.py` file:

    ```python
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    import os

    load_dotenv()

    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN = os.environ.get("SLACK_BOT_TOKEN")
    SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET = os.environ.get("SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET")
    ```

#### 5. Download the Model

Download the model and tokenizer from this Google Drive link:
[Download Model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YCdlOuN_9EUy9kF6j1KKLM3UPi9fJc6R?usp=drive_link)

Place the downloaded files in the `model_tokenizer/` folder.

#### 6. Run the Application

Run the Slack app using the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

The app should now be running and listening for events from your Slack workspace.

## Usage

1. **Invite the App to a Channel**:

    Invite your Slack app to the channels you want it to monitor.

2. **Real-time Message Analysis**:

    The app will analyze messages in real-time and flag potentially offensive content.

3. **Review and Adjust**:

    Review the flagged messages and adjust the app's settings or model as needed to improve accuracy.

## Future scope
1. To ensure long-term effectiveness, the model must be frequently re-trained to adapt to evolving language patterns, emerging slang, and nuanced forms of harassment, maintaining high detection accuracy. 
2. Additionally, expanding the model with multilingual capabilities will enhance its usability across diverse countries and organizations, fostering a more inclusive and globally adaptable solution. 
3. Future advancements could integrate contextual AI to better understand intent, improve real-time adaptability through continuous learning, and incorporate multimodal analysis by combining speech, text, and facial expression recognition for more precise harassment detection.
